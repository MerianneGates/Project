        <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Idaho where I enjoyed participating in ballroom dancing, piano, and student council. Upon
            graduation I went to Phoenix to attend DeVry University where I was excited to earn my business degree at an
            accelerated pace. Once complete, I returned to Utah where I started working on my career, and ultimately was
            married and started a family. After being home raising small children for 10 years, I’m ready to learn and
            prepare to re-enter the work force and continue to develop my skills in a career I love.</p>
