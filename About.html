    <Section>I am an Idaho girl born and raised. I grew up in Rigby, Idaho, the youngest of 4 children. I attended
        college in Phoenix where I enjoyed having winters off and palm trees. Upon graduation, I moved to Utah to be
        closer to family and settle into a career. I currently live in Draper with my husband and 3 kids who are growing
        way too fast. As they each take off to school, I see opportunity for me to develop skills to eventually begin a
        new career in the tech industry!</Section>
